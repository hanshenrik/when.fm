# last.fm API key
Since I haven't made this into a proper app yet, you'll need to provide your own last.fm API key if you want to run this locally.

1. Retrieve an API key at https://www.last.fm/api (free)
2. Create a copy of `config/local.json.example` to `config/local.json` and replace the dummy API key with your key

# Running

```
  $ yarn start
```
